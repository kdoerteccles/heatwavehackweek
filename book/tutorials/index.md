# Tutorials

These tutorials consist of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run in our 
[preconfigured software environment](https://github.com/snowex-hackweek/docker-image). 
If you are attending the hackweek, you have access to a JupyterHub environment 
with all the necessary Python software packages installed that are needed to run 
through these tutorials interactively. On JupyterHub, your home directory persists 
so any changes you make to the tutorials will be saved and be there for you next 
time you log in.
